# 👋 Hello World! 🌎 my name is Omar and I am a recent University Graduate 🎓, welcome to my page!

A little about me ...

>I like to keep learning new technologies, I enjoy programing front-end applications such as MERN Stack applications and native Android. I wish to continue my exploration to the cloud and configure services such as AWS and Firebase.  

>I don't have a favorite language because I believe that once you learn and fundamentally understand the different paradigm shifts of programming languages, learning and efficiently programming in a new language will be an easy task. I will say however I learned all my fundamentals on Object-Oriented principles in C++. 

⚡ An interesting fact about me ... I set all my IDEs with `vim` emulation.

### I've highlighted some of the key projects that I wish to share with the world.

# [Floor Coverage](https://github.com/FloorCoverage/FloorCoverageSite) 💎
>This is the biggest project in my repository. It's a __FOSS ruby on rails website__. You can check out this site __[here](http://floorcoverage.herokuapp.com/users/sign_in)__. It was developed using __agile methodology__ for my university senior project with student colleagues. I am currently __the maintainer__.


## [P.I.E](https://github.com/FrancescoLimoni/P.I.E) 🥧 
As in _"Phot Image Editor"_ 
>This is an image editor built entirely in ruby. I was in charge of the __floating UI__ and the __start up page__. This project was built using agile methodology.

## [MERN STACK project](https://github.com/OmarBitar/omarsFilmCaveFrontEnd) 🌐 
>This is a __full MERN stack project__, but it's a bit old. It was implemented before react hooks and functional components were introduced. I have stopped supporting it but it still runs, however, I believe that the mongo database was dropped.

to stay updated I created the following

## [React Budget App](https://github.com/OmarBitar/react_buget_app_tut) 🏦 
>This is not my biggest react project but it is my most recent. I created it because I want to practice implementing __fucntional compnents__ and __react hooks__. I wish to keep my knowledge in react updated.

and to practice more webserver skills such as es6 and async I created the following: 

## [asyncrounous node app](https://github.com/OmarBitar/expressNodeReview) 🔄
>I created this project because I wanted to explore and practice creating __asyncronys callbacks__ as it is essential to web development. Feel free to run it on postman, it's a fun project.

## [A cool API i made](https://github.com/OmarBitar/guess_where_project)
>I set up an authenticated API to interact with a frond-end android application, its really cool, check it out. 

>The concept of the app is that a user will upload a picture online and other users have to guess where the picture was taken

Finally switching to a mobile project 
## [Android Watchlist](https://github.com/OmarBitar/simple_android_watchlist) 📱
>I created this project because rather than just following along the code from a book I am reading to learn android development, I wanted to do it entirely from scratch with no handholding from the book. 

>This project explores __the Android Lifecycle__ which includes the __Activity Lifcycle__ and the __Fragment Lifcycle__. __Rresusuable Fragments__. 


finally, I would like to share this:
## [philosopher problem project](https://github.com/OmarBitar/philoserpher_problem) 🤔
>This project will ask you to initialize however many processes you desire and it will use the __philosopher algroithim__ to determine the states of which process to run. I did this when I was still in university, but I really enjoyed this assignment and I wish to share it with the world.
